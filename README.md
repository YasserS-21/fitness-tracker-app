## **Fitness Tracker Project Documentation**

### **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a fitness tracker mobile application to help users track their workouts, nutrition, and overall fitness progress. The app will leverage a microservices architecture, with each service responsible for a specific functionality.

### **How to run the project**

- npm run android
- npm run ios # you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to do iOS development without a Mac
- npm run web

### **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend:** React Native
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Cloud Platform:** GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or CircleCI

### **Microservices Architecture**

1. **User Service:**
   - Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
   - Stores user information, including personal details, fitness goals, and preferences.
2. **Workout Service:**
   - Tracks workouts, including type, duration, and intensity.
   - Stores workout history and generates workout plans.
3. **Nutrition Service:**
   - Tracks food intake, calories, and macronutrients.
   - Provides personalized nutrition recommendations.
4. **Social Service:**
   - Handles social features like friend connections, challenges, and forums.

### **Development Process**

**Backend Development:**

- Set up Node.js and Express.js backend.
- Implement RESTful APIs for user authentication, workout tracking, nutrition tracking, and social features.
- Integrate with MongoDB for data storage.
- Implement security measures (e.g., authentication, authorization, input validation).

**Frontend Development:**

- Design and develop the user interface using React Native.
- Implement features like user registration, login, workout tracking, nutrition tracking, and social features.
- Integrate with the backend API to fetch and send data.

**Containerization and Deployment:**

- Create Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend services.
- Build Docker images.
- Set up a Kubernetes cluster on a GKE.
- Deploy the Docker images to the Kubernetes cluster.
- Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.

### **Deployment and Maintenance**

- Deploy the application to GKE.
- Monitor the application's performance and health.
- Implement security measures to protect user data.
- Regularly update the application to fix bugs and add new features.

### **Future Enhancements**

- **Machine Learning:** Implement machine learning algorithms for personalized recommendations.
- **Wearable Integration:** Integrate with wearable devices to track real-time fitness data.
- **Augmented Reality:** Use AR to provide interactive workout experiences.
